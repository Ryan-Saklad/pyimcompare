# pyimcompare
Pyimcompare was created to be able to find similar images within a larger image, likely to be used for screen scraping. By default, an image name (with its file extension) or a cv2 image object should be entered as the smaller image. The larger image is the screen by default, but can be changed to be an image name (with its file extention) or a cv2 image object. The threshold is how similar given image and the image in the larger image should be, with the threshold being on a scale of 0 to 1. The Maximum Results will give at most that many images back, but sometimes will give less than that many. The delay will wait the given time before returning any results.
